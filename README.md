 # MySimulinkLib 
 
Simulink implementation of various stuffs ranging from Numerical solvers to Attitude determination algorithms. Most of the code especially for AD alogirthms has been in Code form. 
My intention is to do it using Simulink since large and most simulations are built around Simulink.
