Attitude Determination Algorithms using Simulink
I have found only code implementations of the algorithms which sometimes might not serve the purpose. My attempt is to do it using Simulink and the hope is that others might as well find it useful.
Algorithms presented in the following papers are implemented:

1. Harold D. Black - A Passive System for Determining the Attitude of a Satellite (1964) [Tri-axial Attitude Determination (TRIAD method)]
2. Paul B. Davenport - A Vector Approach to the Algebra of Rotations with Applications (1968) [Davenport's q-method]
3. F. Landis Markley - Attitude Determination using Vector Observations and Singular Value Decomposition (1968) [SVD method]
4. Malcolm D. Shuster - Three-axis Attitude Determination from Vector Observations (1981) [Quaternion Estimator (QUEST)]
